# Yen's_algorithm
Yen's algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph with non-negative edge cost. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen%27s_algorithm)
Here, I implemenet Yen's algorithm in Python using NetworkX graph package and tested it using the example in its wiki page.

A lot of improvement can still be done on this code. Feel free to contact me.
